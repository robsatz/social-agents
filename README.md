# NMA Macrocircuits

Modelling the social behaviors of multiple worms with and without architectural pirors

# Setup

- The scripts works in Python==3.10. Other packages can be install via `packages.txt`. 
```
cd lib
git clone https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic.git
cd ..
python setup.py install
```

The setup.py file installs both the `tonic` dependency and our own package as `social_agents`.
